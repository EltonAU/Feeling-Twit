# Feeling-Tweet
A web application that shows a semantic analysis of a twitter stream (in real-time), based on the input keyword. 
(Not usable anymore because it needs azure database server to store the responses, and the database server is not available anymore).

To see the web interface only:
1. Install nodejs
2. Clone this repos, run index.js file with "node index.js"
3. Open browser, go to localhost:3000
